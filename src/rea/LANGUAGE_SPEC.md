### Rea: An Object-Oriented Language Specification

This document outlines a plan for implementing **Rea**, a new,
object-oriented front end for the PSCAL Virtual Machine (VM). The language is
designed for readability and ease of use while leveraging the VM's stack-based
architecture and existing capabilities. The design builds upon concepts found
in the existing C-Like and Pascal front ends to introduce a class-based
programming paradigm.

***

### 1. Language Semantics and Features

The Rea language is a strongly typed, class-based, object-oriented language.

#### 1.1. Lexical Structure

* **Comments:** Supports single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments
  with `/* ... */`.
* **Identifiers:** Identifiers for variables, classes, and methods are
  case-sensitive. They must begin with a letter or an underscore and can be
  followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscores.
* **Keywords:**
    * **Data Types:** `int`, `int64`, `int32`, `int16`, `int8`, `float`,
      `float32`, `long double`, `char`, `byte`, `str`, `text`, `mstream`,
      `void`, `bool`.
    * **Class & Object:** `class`, `new`, `extends`, `this`, `super`.
    * **Control Flow:** `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `do`, `switch`, `case`,
      `default`, `break`, `continue`, `return`.
    * **Other:** `const`, `#import`.
* **Literals:** Integer, floating-point, character, and string literals will
  follow the C-Like language specification.

#### 1.2. Data Types

Rea uses the VM's primitive types but standardizes on 64-bit integer and
floating-point types as the default for new development.

| Rea Keyword | VM Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `int` | `TYPE_INT64` | 64-bit signed integer. |
| `int32` | `TYPE_INT32` | 32-bit signed integer. |
| `int16` | `TYPE_INT16` | 16-bit signed integer. |
| `int8` | `TYPE_INT8` | 8-bit signed integer. |
| `float` | `TYPE_DOUBLE` | 64-bit floating-point number. |
| `float32` | `TYPE_FLOAT` | 32-bit floating-point number. |
| `long double` | `TYPE_LONG_DOUBLE` | Extended precision floating-point number. |
| `str` | `TYPE_STRING` | Dynamic-length string. |
| `bool` | `TYPE_BOOLEAN` | Boolean values (`true` and `false`). |
| `void` | `TYPE_VOID` | Absence of value (for procedures). |

#### 1.3. Object-Oriented Programming

* **Class Definition:** The `class` keyword defines a new type that can contain
  data fields and methods. Fields are declared like variables, and methods are
  defined like functions. A class is a pointer type, so a variable of a class
  type will hold a pointer to an object instance.
* **Constructors:** A special method with the same name as the class will serve
  as the constructor. It initializes the object's fields. A constructor will
  not have a return type.
* **Object Instantiation:** The `new` keyword will allocate memory for a new
  object on the heap and call the class's constructor. This will translate to a
  sequence of opcodes that handle memory allocation and initialization,
  leveraging the existing VM memory management.
* **Field and Method Access:** The dot `.` operator is used to access an
  object's fields and methods.
* **`this` and `super`:** The `this` keyword provides a reference to the
  current object instance within a method. The `super` keyword provides a
  reference to the parent class's constructor and methods, allowing for proper
  initialization and method overriding.
* **Inheritance:** The `extends` keyword will be used to create a subclass that
  inherits fields and methods from a parent class.
* **Polymorphism:** Method overriding will be supported. To implement this on
  the PSCAL VM, the compiler will generate a virtual method table (V-table) for
  each class. This table would be a constant array of function pointers. When a
  method is called, the bytecode will look up the correct function pointer in
  the V-table based on the object's dynamic type, enabling polymorphic
  behavior.
* **No Overloading:** As specified, method overloading will not be supported.
  Each method within a class, and each top-level function, must have a unique
  name.
* **Built-in Routines:** Rea will have access to the VM's built-in functions
  and procedures. This includes core built-ins like `writeln` and `printf`, as
  well as extended built-ins for I/O, string manipulation, mathematics, and
  threading.

### 2. Implementation Plan

The implementation will focus on creating a compiler for Rea that translates
source code into PSCAL VM bytecode. The process involves a front-end component
(parser, semantic analyzer) and a back-end component (code generator).

#### 2.1. Front End (Rea Compiler)

* **Lexical Analysis:** A new lexer will be created to parse the Rea syntax,
  including new keywords and literals, and produce a stream of tokens.
* **Parsing:** A new parser will build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for Rea
  code. It must be able to handle class definitions, method declarations,
  inheritance relationships, and method calls.
* **Semantic Analysis:** This phase will perform type checking and resolve
  symbols (variables, methods, class names). The compiler will need a symbol
  table that can manage class-scoped symbols and handle inheritance, ensuring
  that field and method lookups are correct.

#### 2.2. Back End (Code Generation)

This is where the translation to PSCAL VM opcodes occurs.

* **Class Representation:** A class will be represented in the bytecode as a
  type definition with a list of its fields and methods. An object instance
  will be a structured block of memory similar to a Pascal `record` or C
  `struct`.
* **Object & Field Opcodes:**
    * `new ClassName(...)` → A call to a runtime built-in function that
      allocates a block of memory for the object and initializes it. This could
      use the `OP_INIT_LOCAL_ARRAY` opcode with a new type for objects.
    * `obj.field = value` → `OP_GET_GLOBAL_ADDRESS` (or
      `OP_GET_LOCAL_ADDRESS`) to get a pointer to the object, followed by
      `OP_GET_FIELD_ADDRESS` to get a pointer to the field. Finally,
      `OP_SET_INDIRECT` to write the value to the field.
* **Method Dispatch Opcodes:**
    * `obj.method()` → The compiler will determine if `method` is a virtual
      method (i.e., overridden). If it is, the compiler will emit opcodes to:
        1. Push the object reference onto the stack.
        2. Push arguments.
        3. Look up the correct function pointer from the object's V-table based
           on its type.
        4. Call the function using a modified `OP_CALL`.
    * **VM Extension:** The VM's `CallFrame` and `procedureTable` will be
      extended to store and look up class and method information to support the
      V-table mechanism.

### 3. Summary of Rea Implementation Details

* **Compiler:** A new compiler will be developed to translate Rea source code
  into PSCAL VM bytecode.
* **Virtual Machine:** The existing PSCAL VM will be extended with minimal
  changes, primarily in the symbol table and `CallFrame` to support
  object-oriented constructs like V-tables for dynamic method dispatch.
* **Opcodes:** The implementation will reuse many existing opcodes for
  arithmetic and control flow. New bytecode opcodes may be introduced to
  simplify object and method handling.
